  "text": "The revolution in the measurement and collection of data and the resulting huge amounts of data have made data science a very important field of study and research. Today researchers are mining data available from various sources, such as web query logs, social media posts and blogs, satellites, sensors,  network traffic, and more .\n<br><br>\n Our lab focuses on analyzing large-scale data streams such as news, blogs, sensor data, social media and more to provide personalization, perform predictive analytics, and identify anomalies in the data. \n<br><br>\nOur research covers a range of topics in machine learning and data science.  A current focus is using Deep Learning techniques to build concise representations of the meanings of user's context and use these powerful features to provide accurate personal recommendations .\n<br><br>\n \nAnother focus is the application of machine learning for cyber security. In various projects we collect network data, honeypot data, or transaction data, to detect anomalies or fraud, predict the malware behavior and perform continuous authentication and more.<br>\nThe lab is lead by Prof. Lior Rokach and Prof. Bracha Shapira. Many graduate and Ph.D students are engaged in the lab. Many of them are engaged in the Msc. degree with focus on Data Science at the ISE department.\n<br><br>\nThe lab collaborates with many partners in the relevant industry.",
