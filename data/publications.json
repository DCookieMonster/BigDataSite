    "abstract": "in this paper we present Nesto, a network selection\n\nand offloading system for android based mobile devices. Nesto\n\nchooses the best connectivity solution between available\n\nheterogeneous wireless networks using network switching. The\n\nsuggested framework supports several configurable policies and\n\naddresses the following requirements: battery energy saving,\n\nbandwidth maximization, an offloading strategy for cellular\n\noperators and granting the best available network QoS to current\n\nrunning applications (e.g. minimizing delay and jitter for voip\n\napplications). Nesto is designed to support two primary\n\nconnectivity modes: a traditional single connectivity mode and a\n\nfull dual mode, where both the cellular and ad-hoc WiFi\n\nnetworks are used simultaneously. The full dual mode allows us\n\nto extend the always best connected definition from the device\n\nlevel to the application level, i.e.: selecting the best network for\n\neach application. This paper presents the architecture of Nesto\n\nand the different network selection optimization models. We\n\nevaluate our solution with simulated data and with real network\n\ntraffic traces. Preliminary results indicate that: (1) energy\n\nefficient policies rely on the single connectivity operation mode,\n\nbut they can be controlled to improve other networking QoS\n\nmeasures with minimum energy overhead, (2) using the full dual\n\noperation mode improves the overall networking performances\n\nof the device, (3) the full dual operation mode enables an efficient\n\nalways best connected solution at the application level, optimizing\n\nthe relevant measures for each application type.",
