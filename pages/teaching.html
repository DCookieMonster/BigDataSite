        <strong>Program of Study</strong><br>
        The studies towards MSc Degree in Information Systems Engineering with Focus on
        Data Mining and Business Intelligence comprise 36 credits including eight mandatory and
        elective courses of 3.0 – 4.0 each and Master Thesis (12 credits).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Supplementary Courses without credit</strong><br>
        A student admitted to the program, specifically without a degree in Information Systems
        Engineering, Software Engineering, Computer Science, or Industrial Engineering, may be required to
        take supplementary courses until the end of the second semester. One can take supplementary courses from the
        courses offered by Ben-Gurion University or equivalent courses from other accredited universities subject to
        recommendation by the departmental teaching committee and approval by the Faculty teaching committee.
